/*
	Procedural water surface.

	Drives a subdivided plane through meshDeform, the same path the cloth
	uses: a welded collision mesh of the plane seeds the points, a sum of
	sine waves moves them, and analytic normals from the same sum keep the
	shading and any generated UVs alive.

	The two texture layers scroll through the material's tile settings, so
	the mesh must be drawn through the per-frame material path (recorded
	objects), never a fully recorded display list.
