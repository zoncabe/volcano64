/*
	Verlet cloth with distance constraints solved by relaxation.

	Implements the method in "Advanced Character Physics" (Thomas Jakobsen,
	IO Interactive, GDC 2001), the cloth and ragdoll solver of the fysix
	engine used in Hitman.

	Two properties make it cheap enough to run on the CPU here. Verlet keeps
	the previous position instead of a velocity, so integration is one
	multiply-add per axis. And constraints are satisfied by projecting
	positions with Jakobsen's square-root approximation: a satisfied
	constraint returns exactly the rest length, so expanding the root to
	first order around it costs one division per constraint and no sqrt.

	The particle array is the simulation state and doubles as the source for
	meshDeform_apply, so the rendered mesh follows without a copy in between.
