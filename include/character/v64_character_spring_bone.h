	Port of Godot's SpringBoneSimulator3D
	(scene/3d/spring_bone_simulator_3d.cpp) as a skeleton modifier: one verlet
	tail per joint, stepped once per frame with the frame's delta, simulated
	in character space (the "center") so only the animation and gravity move
	it. A set listed root to tip simulates as a chain: each joint reads the
