/*
	Camera-pitch aim bend, split evenly along a spine chain.

	The delta is never added in a bone's own frame: the aiming pose keeps the
	torso half-turned at whatever angle the clip authored, so a local axis is
	tilted with it. The bend is built once about the world's horizontal side
	axis and conjugated into each bone's frame through the rotation the chain
	actually carries this frame, which keeps it pure pitch under any twist.
