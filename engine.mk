# --- engine64 ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The engine's source list and the rule that compiles it from a game. The
# engine never builds on its own: it is always built from the consuming
# project, into that project's build directory.
#
# Consumer contract, before including this file:
#   ENGINE_DIR   path to this repo.
#   BUILD_DIR    the project's build dir (objects land in $(BUILD_DIR)/engine).
#   ENGINE_SKIP  engine units the game replaces (optional), paths relative
#                to $(ENGINE_DIR)/src.
#
# Provides engine_src (paths relative to $(ENGINE_DIR)/src) and the compile
# rule. The project collects its objects like this:
#   objects = $(engine_src:%.c=$(BUILD_DIR)/engine/%.o) ...

# The order matters, and not for tidiness: the VR4300 icache is 16 KB direct
# mapped, so where each function lands in RAM decides who it evicts. Hot path
# first, cold code last.
